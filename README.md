# DSA-Capstone-Data-Analysis-Project--Amazon-Product-Analysis
This is my first project to start my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the incubator hub

 ## Project Topic: Amazon Product Analysis

 ### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Amazon products to uncover patterns and insights that can inform strategic decisions for sellers, marketers, or consumers. The dataset includes key variables such as product category,rating,rating count, discount percentage, and reviews.

The primary goal is to explore how different factors influence product performance across various categories. Key questions include:

 How do average ratings and review counts vary by category?
 Is there a correlation between discount percentage and customer ratings or review volume?
 Which categories exhibit the highest engagement or customer satisfaction?
 What product characteristics are most associated with high performance?

Through data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project aims to provide actionable insights into consumer behavior and market trends on Amazon. The findings can help optimize product listings, pricing strategies, and promotional efforts for e-commerce success.
